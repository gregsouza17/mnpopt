This is an Introduction to Science and Research project, most of the
code here is not mine, it is just a temporary repository for some
testes with optmiziation of some small parts of the code.

The full project is responsability of Dr. L. G. C. Rego and the
DynEmol Simulation Code (http://luisrego.sites.ufsc.br/research/dynemol/)

Their git repository is dedicated to optimization via MPI and otherstuff
that is beyond the scope of my project, my goal is to improve
some of the codes that don't use MPI.
